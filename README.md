# The Restaurant

## Description

Program written in prolog that allows waiters to answer specific questions based on knowledge of the menu, ingredients, and customer characteristics.

## How to run the program

---

## 🧰 Option 1: Native Setup on Windows

### ✅ 1. Install SWI-Prolog

Download from:  
👉 https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html

Choose the 64-bit Windows installer. It comes with:
- `swipl` command-line interface
- XPCE GUI support
- Prolog editor (`PceEmacs`)

### ✅ 2. Run the built-in GUI

To test that XPCE works:
1. Open `swipl`
2. Run this:

```prolog
?- use_module(library(pce)).
?- new(Window, picture('Hello GUI')).
?- send(Window, open).
```

A GUI window should appear! 🎉

---

### ✅ 3. Create Your Own XPCE App (Example: Button)

Save this as `gui_test.pl`:

```prolog
:- use_module(library(pce)).

run :-
    new(Window, dialog('Simple GUI')),
    send(Window, append(button('Click Me', message(@prolog, hello)))),
    send(Window, open).

hello :-
    writeln('Button was clicked!').
```

Run it:

```sh
swipl gui_test.pl
?- run.
```
